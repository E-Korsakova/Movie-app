          There are heroes, there are superheroes, and there is Hancock. Having superpowers comes with responsibility,
          everyone knows that - except him. He takes on any task with his soul and the best intentions, saving peopleâ€™s
          lives - at the cost of inhuman destruction and incalculable damage. Eventually, the public`&apos;`s patience
          is running out: people are grateful to their local hero, but sometimes they don``&apos;`t understand what they
          did to deserve such punishment.
